# HackUTA Supabase Backend

This folder handles the supabase config and systems,
if this isn't the HackUTA 2025 team, there are exactly
two things you need to do.

1. Update the `config.toml` file you'll see in this folder, change the name to `hackuta-{your year here}`
2. Read the comment in `schema/schema.sql` before you make any more changes to the database. It matters.

Once you have done the above, follow [this guide](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-db-push) to push the schema to a specific project and you're ready to go!
